Want to keep track of emails sent to your customers? Easily set BCC email addresses and custom texts for every WooCommerce email template.

== Description ==

Some webmasters may like to keep track of emails being sent to their customers. For that reason we developed WooCommerce Email Manager which enables
you to manually receive blind copies of every WooCommerce email template and translate/change default WooCommerce email texts.

= Improve your Order Management =
Need email copies for accounting or sales department? Easily set a list of BCC emails for every WooCommerce email template.

= Change WooCommerce Email Texts =
Default WooCommerce Email texts may be disappropriate for your business. This Plugin scans your WooCommerce Email Template files to search for text blocks.
Every text block found will be available as option within your email settings. You may change the default email text to whatever you wish.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin. After that you will have a new option field "BCC" for every WooCommerce email template (see WooCommerce > Settings > Emails).
Furthermore the plugin will search your WooCommerce E-Mail Templates for gettext-Strings. You will then be able to set custom texts for certain strings contained within the emails.
Please mind that the number and order of the parameters (e.g. %s or %d) of the original texts must match your translated texts.
